## Why R

(You're here so hopefully you've been persuaded.)

- No licensing issues. More than 8 people can use it at once.
- Robustness - I can share the course notes and know it runs the same on your computer. Point-and-click SAS/SPSS has failed some scientific papers. 
- Reuse - when solving the same problem you can copy-paste existing code.
