#  Crosstabs

Two cases:

## Case 1: with survey weights

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  select(Gender, Education, wt=WTINT2YR) %>% 
  # There's a clever way to do this, but it's easier to write this 3 times.
  filter(!is.na(Gender), !is.na(wt), !is.na(Education)) %>% 
  group_by(Gender, Education) %>% 
  summarise(wt = sum(wt)) %>% 
  group_by(Gender) %>% 
  mutate(wt = scales::percent(wt/sum(wt))) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(Gender, Education), names_from=Gender, values_from=wt) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

```

## Case 2: Without survey weights

Using the [janitor](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/index.html) package. 


```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Education), !is.na(Gender)) %>% 
  tabyl(Education, Gender) %>% 
  adorn_percentages("col") %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 2) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```
